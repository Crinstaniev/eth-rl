# eth-rl

**To-do-list**

Part I: Revise and polish code and merge to one GitHub:

- [X] Set the validators strategy to be evolutionary strategy.
- [X] Set the alpha = 1 strategy as a benchmark for comparison
- [ ] Compare different RL strategies with the benchmark:
- [X] How the proportion of honest agents changes overtime.
- [X] How the proportion of total honest agent effective balance changes overtime
- [ ] How different initial honest agent proportions affect the convergence results.
